    This small program allows you to automatically create a Norminette-compliant Makefile. Compilation occurs with gcc and the -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags. I use separate files for your sources and the help file.

[?] create a sweep option (clean a repository and redistribute files in appropriate directories) for existing projects.
    [-] Put it in a Makefile.init or give the option in the shell program
[?] in two years, add a NCurse interface. Create a proper ft_select to this purpose


[?] Create "make scratch" to start a new project
[?] Create "make order" or "make sweep" to clean an existing repository


[?] Create a "make UI" for User Interface (with NCurse or TermCaps)
[?] Create a "make CLI" for Command Line interface

    [!] The user should be able to choose if (s)he wants to interact with the script via an interface or the shell terminal.
    Such use should be explained distinctively within the help files and commands.

[?] Define a non-complex help system.
    a[-] upon installation, 
    b[-] explain properly the different rules given
    b[-] explain the no-relink property
    c[-] describe the directories
    c[-] describe the make help ressource and how it differs from the actual help of the script creating the Makefile.
        [*] Make help describes the re, clean, fclean, all rules.
            [y] Given time, add a function to automatically update make help when the user adds a new feature
    d[-] explain the choice on the arborescence for the directories
    e[?] create a man page ?
