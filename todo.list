    This small program allows you to automatically create a Norminette-compliant Makefile. Compilation occurs with gcc and the -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags. I use separate files for your sources and the help file.

# describe make help
# describe sources
# create a sweep option (clean a repository and redistribute files in appropriate directories) Great for existing projects.
## Put it in a Makefile.init or give the option in the shell program
# explain properly the different rules given
# explain the no-relink property
# in two years, add a NCurse interface. Create a proper ft_select to this purpose
